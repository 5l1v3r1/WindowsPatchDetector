# Experimental Windows .text section Patch Detector
======================

Experimental: Windows .text section compare - disk versus memory

###### Original Idea
After reading about the Skeleton Key malware (http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/threats/skeleton-key-malware-analysis/) develop a small tool which would compare the .text section of .exe and .dll files on disk with their RAM equivilent to detect patches.

###### Result
Working on the whole for 32bit binaries... need to add support for 64bit...

###### Features
This tool
* either for specific or all 32bit Windows processes enumerates the modules (.exe's and .dll's)
* find the .text (code) section in RAM
* find the .text (code) section on disk
* compares them taking into account base relocations

###### Command Line Options
* -h help
* -p [PID] - only analyze this PID
* -v - show the byte by byte diffs

###### Example Output
```
